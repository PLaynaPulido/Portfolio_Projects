  <p>- The purpose of our website is to facilitate the buying and selling of used cars between users. Users can look at
available cars in our company in the "Available Cars" tab which were inspected by our car inspectors before
being put on sale. All cars have been inspected to guarantee product safety to all buyers.</p>
  <p>- Users must contact the car's owner before buying the car to be able to obtain information about
the product and negotiate an agreement between the buyer and seller. Once you send the message to the seller, the
seller will receive a mail with your profile information. The seller will contact you to give you the details of the sale.</p>
  <p>- Users can sell their cars in the "Sell Your Car" tab. You'll require to give information about your car, your profile, and
your address. Once you fill in all the information, you'll need to make an appointment with one of our car inspectors
to check your car's conditions and approve the sale of your car in our website.</p>
  <p>- Car registration at your name is required to sell your car. A fee of $40, which is paid after inspection, is required
to inspect and put into sale your car in our website.</p>
  <p>- Once the car has been sold, the seller must inform the company about sale to take out the car from the website. A
10% of the final sale price will be kept by the company.</p>
